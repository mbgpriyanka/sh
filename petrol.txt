Gasoline (North American English; /ˈɡæsəliːn/) or petrol (Commonwealth English (except Canada); /ˈpɛtrəl/) (see § Etymology) is a transparent, slight yellowish petroleum-derived flammable liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in most spark-ignited internal combustion engines (also known as petrol engines). It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of additives. On average, U.S. refineries produce, from a barrel of crude oil (42 U.S. gallons or about 159 liters), about 19 to 20 gallons of gasoline; 11 to 13 gallons of distillate fuel (most of which is sold as diesel fuel); and 3 to 4 gallons of jet fuel. The product ratio depends on the processing in an oil refinery and the crude oil assay.[2]

The characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating, which is produced in several grades. Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds, once widely used to increase octane ratings, are no longer used except in aviation,[3] off-road and auto-racing applications.[4] Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness, and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as ethanol, MTBE, or ETBE to improve combustion.

Gasoline can enter the environment (uncombusted), both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport, and delivery (e.g., from storage tanks, from spills, etc.). As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks.[5] Gasoline contains known carcinogens.[6][7][8] When burned, one liter (0.26 U.S. gal) of gasoline emits about 2.3 kilograms (5.1 lb) of CO2, a greenhouse gas, contributing to human-caused climate change.[9][10] Oil products, including gasoline, were responsible for about 32% of CO2 emissions worldwide in 2021.[11]
n most Commonwealth countries (except Canada), the product is called "petrol" rather than "gasoline" or, in common parlance, simply "gas". Hence the prevalence of the use of "Gas Station" in Canada. The slang term "gas" in reference to Gasoline can be ambiguous with Natural Gas (also referred to as simply "gas"), which is often used for home heating. Very few people use the full term "gasoline" in lieu of "gas" in most instances of speech or written communication.

The word petroleum, originally used to refer to various types of mineral oils and literally meaning "rock oil", comes from Medieval Latin petroleum (petra, "rock", and oleum, "oil").[15][16] "Petrol" was used as a product name in about 1870, as the name of a refined mineral oil product sold by British wholesaler Carless, Capel & Leonard, which marketed it as a solvent.[17] When the product later found a new use as a motor fuel, Frederick Simms, an associate of Gottlieb Daimler, suggested to John Leonard, the owner of Carless, that they register the trademark "Petrol",[18] but by that time the word was already in general use, possibly inspired by the French pétrole,[19] and the registration was not allowed because the word was a general descriptor; Carless was still able to defend its use of "Petrol" as a product name due to their having sold it under that name for many years by then. Carless registered a number of alternative names for the product, but "petrol" nonetheless became the common term for the fuel in the British Commonwealth.[20][21]

British refiners originally used "motor spirit" as a generic name for the automotive fuel and "aviation spirit" for aviation gasoline. When Carless was denied a trademark on "petrol" in the 1930s, its competitors switched to the more popular name "petrol". However, "motor spirit" had already made its way into laws and regulations, so the term remains in use as a formal name for petrol.[22][23] The term is used most widely in Nigeria, where the largest petroleum companies call their product "premium motor spirit".[24] Although "petrol" has made inroads into Nigerian English, "premium motor spirit" remains the formal name that is used in scientific publications, government reports, and newspapers.[25]

The use of the word gasoline instead of petrol is uncommon outside North America,[26][failed verification][unreliable source?] although gasolina is used in Spanish and Portuguese and gasorin is used in Japanese.

In many languages, the name of the product is derived from benzene, such as Benzin in Persian and German or benzina in Italian; but in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, the colloquial name nafta is derived from that of the chemical naphtha.[27]

Some languages, like French and Italian, use the respective words for gasoline to indicate diesel fuel.[28]
